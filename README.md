# Time-management
Spting Cloud netflix OSS. Wht we have now: Eureka, WebFlux, MongoDB, Feign. (this list will be updated)

The core idea of this web-application is time management. So we will have users, who could make their subjects with tasks.
Subject consists of id, title, color, description.
Task consists of id, title, description, date & subject id.
User will have id, name, email (for getting notifications about next week tasks), encoded pass.
Also I'm thinking about notification service to send emails.

I'm actually making it to learn Spring cloud Netflix reactive stack & for my own needs.
